# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Playing with PHP Laravel Framework and how it works.

**Thoughts:** Not to much. Seems like an easy project structure to begin with.

### Day 1: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added main controller, create new layout, views and routes.

**Thoughts:** Larabel routing system is easy, also layout system and controllers. It seems like laravel is easy to learn, and well structured.
